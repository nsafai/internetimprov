## Generation Order (Recommended)

Start with Casey (shots 1, 2, 10) since you have reference images, then expand to other characters:

1. **Casey shots** - Validate pipeline with existing references
2. **Rex** - Similar "straight" energy to Casey
3. **Fizz** - Most dynamic, may need more iterations
4. **Harper** - Softer expressions
5. **Mira** - Theatrical poses
6. **Dot** - Subtle expressions
7. **Byte** - Unique digital aesthetic

## Runway Animation Notes

For best results with Runway Gen-3:
- All shots framed as medium shots (waist/chest up)
- Clear face visibility for lip sync
- Clean, uncluttered backgrounds
- Neutral starting pose for smoother motion
- Avoid extreme expressions in static image (Runway will animate them)

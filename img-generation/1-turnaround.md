Create a complete character turnaround model sheet for **[Character]** using the provided reference image to match his exact face structure, outfit, proportions, colors, and personality. Show [Character] in four views: **front**, **3/4 view**, **side profile**, and **back view**. Keep the same stylized soft 3D visual aesthetic as the reference (Pixar/DreamWorks style): smooth shading, expressive sculpting, clean lines, and warm lighting. Maintain [Character]’s calm, rational, slightly exasperated narrator vibe. Outfit must match exactly. Clean, neutral background, animation-ready layout. Ensure perfect consistency with the reference image.

# 🎭 INTERNET IMPROV — Creative Vision Summary

You’re building an **animated sketch-comedy troupe** that reenacts the internet’s best comments, stories, and threads as **mini “improv performances.”**

This is NOT a screenshot page.  
This is NOT a typical Reddit-story narrator channel.  
It’s something new:

**“An improv theatre company performing the internet.”**

---

# ⭐ Core Concept
A cast of recurring animated characters performs short, comedic, dramatic, or wholesome reenactments of internet threads.

- OP = the “prompt”  
- Top comment = the “script”  
- Your characters = the performers  
- The reenactment = the show  

Each episode feels like a **tiny sketch** inspired by something found on the internet.

The tone is intentionally **extra, theatrical, improvised, chaotic, self-aware.**

# 🎨 Visual Style (High Level)
- Fully animated  
- Distinct, cohesive art direction

- Visual exaggeration encouraged  
- Scenes built around simple staging (“internet theatre stage”)  
- Bright colors and expressive movement  

The goal: **one frame should be enough to know it’s Internet Improv.**

# 🎬 Content Format
Each episode is a short, structured sketch:

1. **Hook (1–2s)**  
   “Internet Improv presents…”

2. **OP Setup (3–5s)**  
   Casey reads the prompt  
   Cast reacts or volunteers to perform  

3. **Comment Reenactment (5–15s)**  
   The assigned character acts it out  
   Emphasis on exaggerated delivery  

4. **Improvised Chaos (3–8s)**  
   Other characters jump in  
   Meta humor, breaking the script  

5. **Punchline Tag (1–3s)**  
   Rex delivers a burn  
   Fizz runs off-screen  
   Harper cries  
   Mira dramatically collapses  

6. **Outro (1–2s)**  
   “Follow for more Internet Improv”

This is a platform-friendly, scalable creative brand.

## Original Post

**u/adrianmoorfield:**

"There is a coffee shop next to my office and on my first day I was super nervous so I mumbled my name when the barista asked. She repeated it as 'Kevin' and wrote that on the cup. I am not Kevin, not even close, but there were people behind me and I panicked and just nodded. The problem is that I kept going back. Every morning she greets me like 'Hey Kevin, usual iced latte', and at this point correcting her feels illegal. She has told other customers that I am one of her favorite regulars, asked how my 'dog' is doing because apparently one day I mentioned having a dog. I do not own any pets. Last week she gave me a free muffin because 'Kevin has had a rough week'. I have no idea what version of me she has built in her head, but I am scared that if I tell her my real name the entire lore collapses."

## Why This Works

This thread perfectly demonstrates "yes-and" improv energy, with each commenter building on the Kevin mythos. It escalates from a simple identity mix-up to creating an entire legendary persona, with absurd claims getting progressively more ridiculous (pandas → Chuck Norris shrine → Stevie Wonder's eyes). The rapid-fire delivery and multiple character voices make it perfect for the Internet Improv format.
